# Supervised-ML-Multiple-Linear-Regression--Cars-dataset

The Cars Data:
Data= Cars, 81 observations
VOL= cubic feet of cab space
HP= engine horsepower
MPG= average miles per gallon
SP= top speed, miles per hour
WT= vehicle weight, hundreds of pounds
-Our interest is to model the MPG of a car based on the other variables.
